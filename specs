Specs:

An input form captures a string input from the user.
(if input string then the varible that contains string is string)

An output form returns a string to the user.
(this would require a method that captures the input and then returns a string.)

The output page does not show the phrase inputted by the user without obscuring it.

The inputted string is changed to replace all vowels with dashes.


the switchletters method needs to be called from the main class and then then the switchletters class needs to return the value to the createoutput method.
